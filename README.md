# Analyzing-Coal-Production-Using-Dominance-Analysis
First, I want to prepare my dataset in **coal_production.csv** you can see that.
Then, I define the predictor variables : rain (hours), slippery (hours), and rainfall (mm),
and the target variable : coal production (tonnase).
In this project, I use a Python Library for Accurate and Intuitive Relative Importance of Predictors https://dominance-analysis.github.io/dominance-analysis/.



# Conclusion
Based on the results of the visualization, the following conclusions can be drawn.
1. Linear model of production coal Y = 6324-451(Rain)-40(Slippery)-2(Rainfall).
2. There are 3 predictors that dominate out to increase/decrease coal production, and the most dominating predictor is: rain. 
3. From the 3 predictors, a relative percentage is made so that each of the 3 predictors have a percentage that contributes to increasing/decreasing coal production. 
4. The Company need to focus on these 3 predictors to conduct further research, because these 3 predictors have the most impact on increasing/decreasing coal production.
